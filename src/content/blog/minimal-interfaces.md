Minimalism in interface design is often misunderstood. It's not about removing things until nothing is left. It's about removing things until everything that remains is essential.

## The Discipline of Restraint

Every element on a page competes for attention. Every color, every border, every shadow adds cognitive load. The discipline isn't in adding — it's in knowing what to leave out.

## Kanso

In Japanese aesthetics, _kanso_ (簡素) represents simplicity and the elimination of clutter. It's not emptiness for its own sake, but clarity through reduction. Each remaining element carries more weight, more meaning.

## The Practice

Start with everything. Then remove, one piece at a time, until removing anything else would break the design. What's left is the interface.
