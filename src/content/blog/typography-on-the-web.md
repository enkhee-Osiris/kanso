The web has a serif problem. For years, the default advice was to use sans-serif fonts for screen readability. But with modern displays and better font rendering, that advice is outdated.

## The Case for Serifs

High-resolution screens render serifs beautifully. The extra detail that was once a liability at 72 DPI is now an asset at 200+ PPI. Serifs add warmth, personality, and readability to long-form text.

## Pairing Strategy

A display serif for headings paired with a text serif for body creates hierarchy without contrast shock. Lora and PT Serif, for example, share enough DNA to feel cohesive while maintaining distinct roles.

## The Details

Line height, measure, and spacing matter more than font choice. A well-set paragraph in any typeface will outperform a poorly set paragraph in the "perfect" font. Start with `line-height: 1.5` and a measure of 45-75 characters, then refine from there.
