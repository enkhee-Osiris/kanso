There's a space between design and code that few people talk about. It's not design, and it's not engineering — it's something in between.

## The Gap

Most teams treat design and engineering as separate disciplines. Designers create mockups, engineers implement them. But the most interesting work happens in the translation layer — where visual intent meets technical constraint.

## Why It Matters

When you understand both sides, you start seeing opportunities that neither discipline sees alone. A subtle animation that would take a designer hours to spec can be described in a single CSS transition. A complex layout that seems impossible becomes straightforward with the right grid strategy.

## Moving Forward

The best interfaces come from people who refuse to pick a side. They sketch in code and think in systems. They know that `border-radius: 8px` carries as much design intent as any Figma frame.
