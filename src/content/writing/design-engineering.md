There's a space between design and code that few people talk about. It's not design, and it's not engineering — it's something in between.

## The Gap

Most teams treat design and engineering as separate disciplines. Designers create mockups, engineers implement them. But the most interesting work happens in the translation layer — where visual intent meets technical constraint.

This gap is where decisions live. Should this animation ease in or ease out? Should the layout reflow at 768px or 640px? Should the hover state shift color or opacity? These aren't design questions or engineering questions — they're both.

## The Language Problem

Designers and engineers describe the same things differently. A designer says "it should feel lighter." An engineer asks "do you mean font-weight, color opacity, or box-shadow?" Neither is wrong. They're speaking different dialects of the same language.

The people who bridge this gap develop a kind of bilingual fluency. They can look at a Figma frame and see the CSS grid underneath. They can read a component tree and picture the visual hierarchy it produces.

## Tools Shape Thinking

The tools you use shape how you think about problems. Figma encourages absolute positioning and pixel-perfect layouts. CSS encourages fluid systems and responsive behavior. Neither perspective is complete on its own.

Working in both mediums teaches you to hold two mental models at once. You design with constraints in mind. You code with intent in mind. The result is work that looks considered and behaves correctly — because it was built with both lenses.

## Why It Matters

When you understand both sides, you start seeing opportunities that neither discipline sees alone. A subtle animation that would take a designer hours to spec can be described in a single CSS transition. A complex layout that seems impossible becomes straightforward with the right grid strategy.

You also start catching problems earlier. A design that looks elegant but requires JavaScript to achieve what CSS can do natively. A component structure that's technically clean but produces a confusing visual hierarchy. These are the kinds of issues that only surface at the boundary.

## Moving Forward

The best interfaces come from people who refuse to pick a side. They sketch in code and think in systems. They know that `border-radius: 8px` carries as much design intent as any Figma frame.

This isn't about being a generalist. It's about recognizing that the most impactful work happens at the seams — where two disciplines meet and something new emerges.
